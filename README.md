Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.  The code is written in 
PHP and uses Laravel framework, it is easy for students and volunteers to learn.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the IRM Evangelical Church development team members simply pulls it.
